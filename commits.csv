flag, only visible to sentry orgs) showing a list of the organization's
evaluated feature flags. This component sits below the event contexts.
- The default sort order is evaluation order. The component shows a max
of 10 rows & 2 columns.
- `View All` opens up a drawer similar to the breadcrumbs drawer,
showing all feature flags w/ ability to sort & search.

MichaelSun48,2024-09-12 16:09:34+00:00,"feat(custom-views): Implement ""Add View"" flow to custom views (#77127)

This PR implements an add view flow for custom views. Previously, as a
stop gap solution, clicking ""Add View"" would simply duplicate the query
and sort of the currently selected tab to the new tab. Now, clicking
""Add View"" creates a tab with a blank query, and a new page containing
recommended searches, and any saved searches the user created before
custom-views.

While this feature's design mostly sticks to the mockups, several
important changes have been made. These are:

1. **There is no option to delete Saved Searches.** This was done
because it feels unnecessary to allow the user to permanently delete
their saved searches when the feature itself will be deprecated soon
anyways.
2. **The banner at the top of the page is no longer dismissible.** This
was done because it is the only place that explains that views are
user-scoped. This will likely change post-LA.
3. **The button within the banner is now a feedback button, rather than
a ""Read Docs"" button.** This was done because, well, there are no docs
for custom views yet since it's not even EA'd yet.
4. ~**Added more left-padding to the search suggestion title.** In the
mockups, the row container bled outside of the parent container's left
border. I added a little bit more left padding as a replacement for this
effect.~ Reverted after chatting with Vu

Other considerations that came up as I was creating this: 

* Saved searches currently do not show saved searches created by the
user that are organization scoped (visibility=‚Äúorganization‚Äù). This is
because the endpoint does not appear to send the owner_id of a saved
search back to the frontend currently. Do we want to show those as well?
* I copied over the ""Recommended Searches"" from the designs, but perhaps
there are other searches we could recommend as a discovery function?
(possibly consult Josh Ferge for this)
* Saved searches also store a sort. Do we want to display that anywhere?

Closes https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/issues/76731. The issue is
caused by using different renderer strategies. The renderer for the
_small_ table (the widget's normal view) is using `SimpleTableChart`
which correctly delegates the rendering of special fields to the
relevant dataset's `getCustomFieldRenderer` configuration. The
full-screen modal uses the `DiscoverTable` component, which sets up the
custom renderers differently. There, the custom renderers do _not_ use
the linkifying logic from the table.

This PR ensures that Discover and Discover-ish datasets import and use
the same field renderers. Longer-term the solution would be to move this
logic to the _default_ field renderers or otherwise unify the renderers
used in Dashboards but for now this fixes the issue.",e633ad84b6cd060a32d79f324d03c751996a2968
